Ok, so this is the document on how i got into this Project, it explains what great Events happened on my journey and what I have learnt to do to make Things better, 

and what I will do better in the future if I create something similar. btw. this document is only raw as I didn´t write every day, so don´t expect detailed historial 

Things written down here LOL.



2023 - the year I found out Snapinator and TurbowarpExists, and I told myself I wanna do something similar (conversion from .sb/.sb2/.sb3/.xml to C# Avalonia):

 	that is also the idea of my converter came up inside of my mind.

 	It all started with Windows Forms, I had like 1/3 of it done, and then i accidentally deleted everything XD. i had to rewrite the whole Project in a whole day (what took me weeks, but you know what I learnt from it XD).



2024 - i found out Avalonia, MAUI, and other cross Platform Stuff exists, but i can´t seem to find a way to make programs inside of them. I first started trying to make my Program cross

&nbsp;	platform with AValonia - at first I didn´t get far, and tried testing it with MAUI, but personally it seemed to be harder, even though it shouldn´t have been (i started this with

&nbsp;	Windows forms, so it was Kind of understandable why (Windows Forms is way easier, but also way more Basic)). Later on i figured out how to use Avalonia and then I rewrote the whole

&nbsp;	stuff so it worked with Avalonia. I even tried out implementing .SWF conversion but I blew that Idea off as .SWF Files are deprecated and not really useful for this Kind of Project 

&nbsp;	nyways. 



2025 - I implemented most of the stuff and I actually nearly deleted the whole projet again - luckily I restored it, and I saved it somewhere where I can´t delete it no more - i also 

&nbsp;	make some saves, so when i delete it I havea Little bit of an elederly Version but atleast a Version of what I deleted. I won´t delete something again XD.



2025 - i finally wrote a beta Version :) Yippie! atleast i will upload that one, and yes the Windows Forms Edition will be delted cuz it is not really that important when i can distribute to 	

&nbsp;	Linux too
