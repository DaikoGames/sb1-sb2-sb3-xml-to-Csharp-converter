INFORMATIONS: 
For this Project I used multiple Nuget Packages:

Newtonsoft.Json: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json
LibVLC: https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp
CliWrap: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap
I also made executables now to self installable with Velopack
Velopack: https://github.com/velopack/velopack
AND I used Snapinator: https://github.com/snapinator/snapinator.github.io
Install Dotnet yourself: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download


If you want to build the project from source you can use the Compile Windows.bat CompileLinux.sh or CompileMacOS, based on your OS. 
You don´t need to run CompileInstallerWindows.bat, CompileInstallerLinux.sh or CompileInstallerMacOS.sh, as they are Scripts for making Sandalone Installers out of the Projects.

Building the apps itself takes 10-15 minutes
Building all the installers takes 17 - 20 minutes on x64 windows
